# **QR-AuthNet 🚀 | AI-Powered QR Code Authentication**  

🔍 **Project Overview**  
QR-AuthNet is an advanced deep learning-based solution designed to **differentiate between original and counterfeit QR codes**. By leveraging **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, this project detects subtle print artifacts, ensuring **robust anti-counterfeiting protection** in real-world scenarios.  

🎯 **Key Features:**  
✅ **AI-Powered Classification** – Distinguishes first prints (original) from second prints (counterfeit).  
✅ **Deep Learning Approach** – Uses CNN for high-accuracy detection.  
✅ **Automated Image Preprocessing** – Enhances QR images for reliable feature extraction.  
✅ **Model Evaluation & Insights** – Tracks training performance with metrics & visualizations.  
✅ **Deployment-Ready API** – Designed for seamless real-world integration.
